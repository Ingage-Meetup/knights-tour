# Knights Tour MySQL

So, I was playing around with the idea of how we might set up a query to determine the moves of the knights tour.

As of this iteration, I'm fairly certain it would succeed if given enough time, but no one wants to wait that long.

It might be good to modify it so that it looks for entire matches before moving on to the next possible match.
